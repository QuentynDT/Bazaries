# Bazaries

The Bazeries Cipher, created by Etienne Bazeries, is a cipher containing a key and two square grids. The key is a two digit number and the grids are 5x5 with one letter omitted, usually J or X.

The way the code works is as follows:

Grid 1 is constructed by arranging the letters of the alphabet vertically.

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | A | F | L | Q | V |
| 2 | B | G | M | R | W |
| 3 | C | H | N | S | X |
| 4 | D | I | O | T | Y |
| 5 | E | K | P | U | Z |

Key: 32 aka THIRTYTWO

Grid 2 is constructed by spelling out the key and then filling in the remaining letters of the alphabet.

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | T | H | I | R | Y |
| 2 | W | O | A | B | C |
| 3 | D | E | F | G | K |
| 4 | L | M | N | P | Q |
| 5 | S | U | V | X | Z |
